# Full Resolution CTPA Dataset Configuration
# Supports 512×512×604 volumes with patch extraction

name: FULL_RESOLUTION_CTPA
root_dir: /workspace/Xray-to-CTPA/datasets/
image_channels: 1

# Patch extraction parameters (D, H, W order to match Conv3d)
# Volume shape: [C=1, D=604, H=512, W=512]
patch_size: [256, 256, 256]  # [D, H, W] - creates patches of 256x256x256
stride: [256, 256, 256]       # [D, H, W] - No overlap for memory efficiency

# Data split
train_split: 0.8

# Preprocessing
normalize: true
augmentation: false  # Can add augmentation later

# Statistics
# Full volume shape: [C=1, D=604, H=512, W=512] (Conv3d format)
# Patch size: [D=256, H=256, W=256]
# Stride: [D=256, H=256, W=256] (no overlap)
# Patches per volume: (604/256)×(512/256)×(512/256) ≈ 3×2×2 = 12 patches
# Memory efficient: processes 2 patches at a time (micro-batching)
